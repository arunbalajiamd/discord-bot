Offensive Message Auto-Delete Bot.

This Discord bot is designed to automatically detect and delete offensive messages in real-time. It uses pre-defined filters, including a customizable list of banned words and phrases, to identify inappropriate content. When a message containing offensive language is detected, the bot instantly deletes it and can optionally issue warnings or temporary bans to repeat offenders.

Key Features:

⌛Real-Time Filtering: Automatically scans every message and deletes those containing offensive language.
🎨Customizable Filters: Admins can easily add or remove words from the blacklist to suit the needs of their community.
⚠Warning System: The bot can warn users when they post an inappropriate message and escalate actions for repeat offenses (like muting, kicking, or banning).
📝Logging: Keeps a record of deleted messages and user actions for admin review.
